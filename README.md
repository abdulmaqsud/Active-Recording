Voice-Activated Recorder for Writing
I decided to create a tool to simplify the process of writing a book. 
Traditional methods like writing on paper or using word processors can be exhausting, 
and recording voice often leads to long pauses of silence, making it tiring to listen back.

Overview
This Python program addresses these issues by recording your voice only when you are speaking. 
During periods of silence, the program does not record, which reduces the amount of audio data you need to process later. 
This allows you to focus on your thoughts without pressure, enabling you to speak naturally and refine your sentences without worrying about unnecessary pauses.

How It Works
Voice Activation: The program starts recording when it detects speech and skips over periods of silence.
Efficiency: By not recording silent sections, it helps keep your recordings concise and easier to listen to and edit.
Flexibility: Record your ideas at your own pace and refine your sentences for clarity without being interrupted by long pauses.
Current Status
The tool is fully functional and designed to enhance your writing or any similar voice-recording tasks. I plan to continue improving it over time.

Enjoy a more efficient writing process with this voice-activated recorder!
